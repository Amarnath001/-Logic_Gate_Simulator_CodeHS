# Logic Gate Simulator â€” Educational Puzzle Game ðŸŽ®ðŸ”Œ

An interactive educational game designed to teach K-12 students the fundamentals of Boolean logic through puzzle-based challenges.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- **Level-Based Challenges**
  - **Level 1**: Activate a light using an AND gate.
  - **Level 2**: Solve circuits using an OR gate.
  - **Level 3**: Combine AND, OR, and NOT gates for more complex logic.
- **Interactive Grid**
  - Place gates and wires by clicking grid cells.
- **Visual Feedback**
  - Color-coded gates (blue=AND, green=OR, red=NOT).
  - Light turns green/red to indicate success or failure.
- **Progress Tracking**
  - Levels unlock sequentially with step-by-step instructions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **HTML/CSS**: Grid layouts, animations, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, dynamic grid updates.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
This project was part of the CodeHS Summer 2025 Internship Challenge.  
Originally intended for Bool.com, it was adapted manually using traditional web technologies due to platform credit limitations â€” demonstrating resourcefulness, problem-solving, and technical depth.
